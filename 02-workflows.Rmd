# Data Science Workflows {#workflows}

## Introduction 

- As a data scientist you do not work alone. 
- Even if you do work alone, you are your own collaborator.
- Treat your future self like a current collegue that is new to the team
- This is because when you return to the project that you are working on in several weeks, months or years you will have forgotten most of what you did 
- You will also have forgotten why you made the decisions that you did and what the other options are. 

- The aim here is to provide you with a structure on how you organise and perform your work so that you can be a good collaborator to current collegues and your future self. 
- Yes, this is going to require a bit more effort upfront, but the benefits will compound over time. 

- The structures and workflows that I recommend will be focused around a workflow that predominantly uses R, markdown and LaTeX. Similar techniques, code and software are available to achieve the same things when working with Python, C, Quarto and a range of other programming and mark-up languages. 

To motivate this focus, I will rely on an analogy with natural languages. You probably wouldn't want a complex analysis course that tried to teach in English, Japanese and Maori all at once. First you learn the concepts of complex analysis in one language and then (assuming you are already proficient in another) it is a much simpler step to do complex analysis in that language, though it might require you learning some new vocabulary or slightly different syntax.
