These notes are intended for students on the course **MATH70076: Data Science** in the academic year 2022/23.

As the course is schedled to take place over five weeks, the suggested schedule is

-   1st week: Chapters \@ref(intro) and \@ref(workflows)
-   2nd week: Chapter \@ref(data)
-   3rd week: Chapter \@ref(edav)
-   4th week: Chapters \@ref(production)
-   5th week: Chapter \@ref(context)

A pdf version of these notes may be downloaded [here](./data_science_notes.pdf).

These notes were created by Dr Zak Varty based on a lecture series at Imperial College London that was developed by Dr Purvasha Chakravarti and others.

This is a *sample* book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Usage

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1.  Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

2.  Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
