# Welcome! 

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

This template provides a skeleton file structure that you can edit to create your book. 

The contents inside the .Rmd files provide some pointers to help you get started, but feel free to also delete the content in each file and start fresh.

# Weekly Outlines 

## Week 1 - Data Science Workflows

*Data scientists do not work alone and fitting models is only a small part of the job.*

- Data Science workflow as a cycle: Importance of working reproducibly, openly and in a team.
- Organising a data science project: discussion on workflow, file and code management
- Documenting Workflows and Packaging code
- Project management:  Defining outcomes and scoping projects, (continuous development, agile + jira ?)

* Intro to R package development?
* Bayesian workflow as reading?  


## Week 2 - Acquiring and Sharing Data

*Data can be difficult to acquire and gnarly when you get it.*

- Structure of a webpage. Web Scraping as a source of data
- APIs as a source of data, data files beyond csv.
- Data bases and SQL 

* If too much, spark covered in big data so databases lower priority 

## Week 3 - Cleaning, Exploring and Visualising.

** The hard parts are: picking what question to ask, knowing what information you need to answer that question and clearly articulating your findings** 

- Data cleaning and documenting this process
- Exploratory data analysis for missing data (MCAR, MNAR, etc)
- Data Visualisation: Exploratory and Expository modes  


## Week 4 - Getting your work into production

*Stakeholder buy in depends on explainability, reproducibility and scalability.*

- Reproducible: being able to reproduce your own work at a later date, others being able to reproduce your work, False positives and the garden of forking paths.
- Explainable: Interpretation of models, how that can go wrong (Simpson's paradox) and explainers for back-box models e.g. LIME. 
- Scalable: scripts vs. notebooks, automated workflows (orchestration tools), data growing or changing over time.

(+ Versioning models and keeping track of this, consistent environments docker, comparing performance ?)

* statistical issues around p-value and multiple testing 


## Week 5 - Context and Ethics
*Your work as a data scientist has impact. Make sure it is a positive one * 

- Privacy: GDPR, licensing (or data and software), anonymity Netflix Case-study
- Fairness: Historical bias, Measures of fairness and incorporating these into your models (Facial Recognition)
- Harm: Clinical trails and AB tests. (Facebook emotional manipulation)
- Professional Codes of Conduct
