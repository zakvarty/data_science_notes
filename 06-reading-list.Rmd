# Reading List {#reading-list} 

This reading list is organised by topic, according to each week of the course. These are split into several categories.

- **Core Materials:** These form a core part of the course activities.

- **Reference Materials:** These will be used extensively in the course, but should be seen as helpful guides, rather than required reading from cover to cover.

- **Materials of Interest:** These will not form a core part of the course, but will give you a deeper understanding or interesting perspective on the weekly topic. There might be some fun other stuff in here too.


## Week 1 : Effective Data Science Workflows 

### Workflows - Core Materials 

----

- The [Tidyverse R Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) by Hadley Wickham. 

This will be the coding style guide that we will follow in this course. It is a core reading in week 1 and will serve as a reference text in future weeks.

----

- Greg Wilson, et al (2017). [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510&ref=https://githubhelp.com). PLOS Computational Biology.

A collection of simple ways to implement good computing practices during a research project. The article is aimed specifically at people who are new to computational research.

### Workflows - Reference Materials

----

- [R For Data Science Chapters 2, 6 and 8](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.  

Chapters covering R workflow basics, a scripting and project based workflow. 

----

- [Documentation](https://here.r-lib.org/articles/here.html) for the {here} package 

Documentation and tutorial for creating portable file paths.

--- 

- [R Packages Book](https://r-pkgs.org/) (Second Edition) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan. 

Covers the basics (and much more) of creating your own R package. Will be useful as a reference during the live session in Week 1. The chapter on [function documentation](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html) introduces `{Roxygen2}` and the chapter on [Testing basics](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html) introduces `{testthat}`.

### Workflows - Materials of Interest 

----

- [STAT545, Part 1](https://stat545.com/index.html) by Jennifer Bryan and The STAT 545 TAs

If this is your first time using R in earnest, you might find part 1 of the STAT545 notes from the University of British Columbia helpful in getting set up. Chapters 1 and 2 cover how to install R and RStudio, basics of programming in R and a bare bones workflow. 

----

- [What they forgot to teach you about R, Chapters 2-4](https://rstats.wtf/) by Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester. 

Resources on a project oriented workflow, practising safe paths, and how to name files.

----

-  Broman et al (2017). [Recommendations to Funding Agencies for Supporting Reproducible Research](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/pol-reproducibleresearchrecommendations.pdf). American Statistical Association.

Source of reproducibility definition used in lecture slides and a fun read! 

----

- [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham 

Section introductions on [functional](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/fp.html) and [object oriented](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html) approaches to programming.

----

Atlassian Article on (Agile Project Management)[https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management]

Advice on good practice in programming (language agnostic) and when running projects that involve software. Written in small sections that make the book a joy to dip in and out of. The section on [DRY coding](https://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/dry.pdf) and a few others are freely available. 

---- 

- (Efficient R programming)[https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/] by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace. 

Chapter 5 considers [Efficient Input/Output](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/input-output.html) is relevant to this week. Chapter 4 on [Efficient Workflows](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html) links nicely with last week's topics.  

----

[Towards A Principled Bayesian Workflow](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html#References) by Michael Betancourt.

----

- (Efficient R programming)[https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/] by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace. 

Chapter 5 considers [Efficient Input/Output](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/input-output.html) is relevant to this week.
