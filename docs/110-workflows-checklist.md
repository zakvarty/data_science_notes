# Checklist {#workflows-checklist .unnumbered}


::: {.rmdnote} 
Effective Data Science is still a work-in-progress. This chapter is largely complete and just needs final proof reading.

## Reading 

Use the [workflows section](#workflows-reading) of the reading list to support and guide your exploration of this week's materials.  


## Tasks 

_Core:_ 

-  Find 3  data science projects on Github and explore how they organise their work. Write a post on the EdStem forum that links to all three, and in a couple of paragraphs describe the content and structure of one project.

- Create your own project directory (or directories) for this course and its assignments.

- Write two of your own R functions. The first should calculate the geometric mean of a numeric vector. The second should calculate the rolling arithmetic mean of a numeric vector.

_Bonus:_

- Re-factor an old project to match the project organisation and coding guides for this course. This might be a small research project, class notes or a collection of homework assignments. Use an R-based project if possible. If you only have python projects, then either translate these to R or apply the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide. Take care to select a suitably sized project so that this is a meaningful exercise but does not take more than a few hours. 

- If you are able to do so, host your re-factored project publicly and share it with the rest of the class on the EdStem Discussion forum. 


## Live Session 

In the live session we will begin with a discussion of this week's tasks. We will then create a minimal R package to organise and test the functions you have written. 


Please come to the live session prepared to discuss the following points: 

- Did you make the assignment projects as subdirectories or as their stand alone projects? Why? 

- What were some terms that you had not met before during the readings? How did you find their meanings?

- What did you have to consider when writing your rolling mean function?
