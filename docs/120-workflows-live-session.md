# Data Science Workflows: libe session {#workflows-live-session}


::: {.rmdimportant} 
Effective Data Science is still a work-in-progress. This chapter is currently a dumping ground for ideas, and we don't recommend reading it. 

If you would like to contribute to the development of EDS, you may do so at <https://github.com/zakvarty/data_science_notes>.

## Code
- Code
  - If you do the same thing twice write a function 
  - If your write a function, document it 
  - If you write a function, test it 
  - If might ever want to use your function again, add it to a package
  - naming things revisited: 
    - functions=verbs, 
    - objects=nouns,
    - readable code,
    - CamelCase snakecase pointless.points
    - tidyverse and google style guides for R
  - all filepaths relative to the root directory (the top level of your project)
    - advanced: here::here

## Bigger Picture: Project management

- Project management 
  - Defining outcomes 
  - scoping projects, (rembmember how we said all code for a silg eproject should live in a single directory?)
  - continuous development, agile + jira ?
  - Linking to github (extension)

## Tasks: 

- go to github and find 3 different data science projects, explore how they organise their work. 
- create your own projects for this course and for the assignments. 
- *bonus:* put these on Github (make sure the assignments are private repos!)

## Reading

- Good enough practices in scientific computing 
- Bayesian workflows: Micheal Battencourt
- https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management 

- R4DS project workflow
- here::here 
- R packages 
- happy git with R

## Live Session Plan

Discussion point in live session: 


- Did you make the assignment projects as subdirectories or as their stand alone projects? Why? 
- What were some terms that you had not met before during the readings?



Activity in live session:


- making a minimal R package for this course
