# Introduction {#intro .unnumbered}

## Module Description

Model building and evaluation are are necessary but not sufficient skills for the effective practice of data science. In this module you will develop the technical and personal skills that are required to work successfully as a data scientist within an organisation. 

During this module you will critically explore how to:

- effectively scope and manage a data science project; 
- efficiently acquire, manipulate, and present data;
- interpret and explain your work for a variety of stakeholders;
- ensure that your work can be put into production; 
- assess the ethical implications of your work as a data scientist.

This interdisciplinary course will draw from fields including statistics, computing, management science and data ethics. Each topic will be investigated through a selection of lecture videos, conference presentations and academic papers, hands-on lab exercises, and readings on industry best-practices from recognised professional bodies. 

This course will be assessed entirely by coursework, reflecting the practical and pragmatic nature of the course material.


## Allocation of Study Hours 

**Lectures:** 10 Hours (2 hours per week)

**Group Teaching:** 5 Hours  (1 hour per week)

**Lab / Practical:** 5 hours  (1 hour per week)

**Independent Study:** 105 hours (17 hours per week + 20 hours coursework)

### Learning outcomes 

On successful completion of this module students should be able to:

1. Independently scope and manage a data science project; 
2. Source data from the internet through web scraping and APIs;
3. Clean, explore and visualise data, justifying and documenting the decisions made;
4. Evaluate the need for (and implement) approaches that are explainable, reproducible and scalable;
5. Appraise the ethical implications of a data science projects, particularly the risks of compromising privacy or fairness and the potential to cause harm.

### Module Content 

This module will cover: 

- effective management of a data science project; 
- open and reproducible work flows;
- sourcing and preparing data for analysis;
- exploratory and expository data visualisation;
- minimal requirements for models to go into production;
- ethical implications of modern data science.


### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.
