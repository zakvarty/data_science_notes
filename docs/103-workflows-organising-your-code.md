Effective Data Science is still a work-in-progress. This chapter is currently a dumping ground for ideas, and we don't recommend reading it.

## Code
- Code
  - If you do the same thing twice write a function 
  - If your write a function, document it 
  - If you write a function, test it 
  - If might ever want to use your function again, add it to a package
  - naming things revisited: 
    - functions=verbs, 
    - objects=nouns,
    - readable code,
    - CamelCase snakecase pointless.points
    - tidyverse and google style guides for R
  - all filepaths relative to the root directory (the top level of your project)
    - advanced: here::here
